  <h1>How Basketball Began</h1>
  <p>Basketball was invented in December 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor. He was trying to keep his students active during the cold winter months in Springfield, Massachusetts.</p>

  <p>Naismith wrote down 13 simple rules and nailed a peach basket to the wall of the gym. The first game was played with a soccer ball and nine players on each team.</p>

  <p>Over time, basketball evolved into the fast-paced, global sport we know today. The NBA was founded in 1946 and has since become the top professional league in the world.</p>
